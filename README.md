# DTI-HeNE
DTI-HeNE: a novel method for drug-target interaction prediction based on heterogeneous network embedding
# Requirements
Python >= 3.6
# Quick start
We provide an example script to run experiments on our datasets:
  * Run `hetero_pred_main.py`: predict drug-target interactions having top 30 probability scores.
